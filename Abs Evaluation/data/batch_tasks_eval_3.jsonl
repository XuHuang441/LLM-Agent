The main contribution of this paper is the development of a scalable CNN model that can be trained end-to-end to produce seamless, temporally consistent, and visually pleasing alignments for the image sequences.\n\nSpecifically, we propose a novel deep learning framework for image synchronization, called \"Coordinated Image CNN\" (CoCNN).

Our model yields an average improvement of 12% and a peak improvement of up to 40% in terms of image similarity compared to baseline models.

This study introduces a new, heuristic multi-scale approach to initiate \"zoom-in\" cosmological simulations. We benchmark this method utilizing adaptive convolution with Gaussian white noise and a refined multi-grid Poisson solver, which enhances displacement and velocity accuracy in the simulation realm by several orders of magnitude compared to incumbent techniques. The multi-scale generation is highly localized, mitigating interference ringing. Additionally, an augmented hybrid scheme combines traditional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with grid-based Manchester adaptive multigrid, offering notable Fourier-space benefits over traditional approaches.\n\nIn line with our endeavors, we advance the active learning theory and mathematical intricacies for cosmological perturbation theory's convergence and universe's evolution prior to and post-recombination epochs. Utilizing the parametric solution as a testbed, this research makes significant strides towards accurate spherical collapse and void evolution predictions. Our presented methods, selected through fixed points and singular perturbation expansions, exceed the precision of standard Lagrangian perturbation theory, paving the way to more accurate predictions of nonlinear density and probability distribution function evolution.\n\nLastly, this paper delves into identifying the defining characteristics of dark matter halos. We employ idealized numerical simulations, critically examining how proto-halos converge resulting in nearly cored or power-law density profiles. We uncover that suppressed particle free-streaming enhances the formation of density cusps while smoothing instabilities mitigates noise sensitivity. Moreover, we demonstrate that the initial analogies with NFW profiles are consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium, underpinning our findings with simple analytic models. This research highlights the role of angular momentum in determining inner slopes and exemplifies the impact of evolving scales on latent dynamics and structures in the universe. \n\nOur contributions spur a holistic understanding of cosmological perturbations, delineating improved methods for initializing simulations, resolving phase transitions, and the intricate architecture shaping dark matter formation. This study embodies the intersection of particle physics and cosmology, offering substantial advancements in modeling the universe's growth and structure formation.]"}]}}

Despite this progress, a fundamental challenge remains in capturing the concatenated features from multiple channels of input, such as images and textual descriptions, in an intrinsic manner that can merge data-driven assets into a cohesive model.\n\nMotivated by the potential of collective intelligence in achieving superhuman performance and the benefits derived from multi-agent collaborative learning, this paper introduces \"CollabSens,\" a novel approach to sequentially ingest and integrate multiple intermediate features from a representation network using an ensemble of intelligent nodes. This mechanism leverages the strengths of these nodes to sequentially enhance the model's overall semantic reasoning capabilities.\n\nGuided by extensive empirical investigations, we demonstrate that our proposed architecture significantly outperforms baseline models by fusing pre-trained perceptual and textual representations, leading to 14% improved accuracy in semantic classification tasks across various domains, including ImageNet Limited and Visual Genome. Notably, the proposed ensemble aggregation strategy enables our framework to maintain robustness in the face of noisy or misleading visual cues, attributing to a 'user-friendly' ability of robust semantic categorization.\n\nTo encourage further advancements in domain-specific semantic understanding, we have made the CollabSens framework open-source, inheriting the principles of reflexivity-through-sharing adaptivity between agents, enhancement of local and global semantic representations, and aggregation of intermediate features to achieve more contextually pertinent insights.\n\nIn summary, this paper aims to unveil the scalability and adaptability of multi-agent collaborative learning in the realm of multimodal semantic interpretation, exemplifying its potential in improving representation learning through multisembolic collective intelligence, and encouraging the confluence of ideas in building more robust, informed and user-centric semantic categorization systems.]"}]}}

Our model yields an average improvement of 12% and a peak improvement of up to 40% in terms of image similarity compared to baseline models. Importantly, the scalability of CoCNN is notable as operation in parallel on multi-GPUs significantly enhances computational efficiency for real-time processing of multi-source, large-volume image data.\n\nThe findings of this paper not only significantly advance the state of the art in image synchronization but also open up new possibilities for directing applications in augmented reality, digital photography, remote sensing, and artificial intelligence in general. Our study further contributes to increasing the efficiency, consistency, and scalability of image processing systems and may stimulate developments in related areas such as deep learning for multi-source data integration and natural language processing for context-aware image understanding.]"}]}}

This study introduces a new, heuristic multi-scale approach to initiate \"zoom-in\" cosmological simulations. We benchmark this method utilizing adaptive convolution with Gaussian white noise and a refined multi-grid Poisson solver, which enhances displacement and velocity accuracy in the simulation realm by several orders of magnitude compared to incumbent techniques. The multi-scale generation is highly localized, mitigating interference ringing. Additionally, an augmented hybrid scheme combines traditional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with grid-based Manchester adaptive multigrid, offering notable Fourier-space benefits over traditional approaches.\n\nIn line with our endeavors, we advance the active learning theory and mathematical intricacies for cosmological perturbation theory's convergence and universe's evolution prior to and post-recombination epochs. Utilizing the parametric solution as a testbed, this research makes significant strides towards accurate spherical collapse and void evolution predictions. Our presented methods, selected through fixed points and singular perturbation expansions, exceed the precision of standard Lagrangian perturbation theory, paving the way to more accurate predictions of nonlinear density and probability distribution function evolution.\n\nLastly, this paper delves into identifying the defining characteristics of dark matter halos. We employ idealized numerical simulations, critically examining how proto-halos converge resulting in nearly cored or power-law density profiles. We uncover that suppressed particle free-streaming enhances the formation of density cusps while smoothing instabilities mitigates noise sensitivity. Moreover, we demonstrate that the initial analogies with NFW profiles are consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium, underpinning our findings with simple analytic models. This research highlights the role of angular momentum in determining inner slopes and exemplifies the impact of evolving scales on latent dynamics and structures in the universe. \n\nOur contributions spur a holistic understanding of cosmological perturbations, delineating improved methods for initializing simulations, resolving phase transitions, and the intricate architecture shaping dark matter formation. This study embodies the intersection of particle physics and cosmology, offering substantial advancements in modeling the universe's growth and structure formation.]**Abstract 2:** [Title: Leveraging Multi-Agent Collaborative Learning for Multimodal Semantic Interpretation\nAbstract:\n\nIn recent years, multimodal semantic interpretation methods for image categorization have witnessed a significant surge in performance, facilitated by the prevalence of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Despite this progress, a fundamental challenge remains in capturing the concatenated features from multiple channels of input, such as images and textual descriptions, in an intrinsic manner that can merge data-driven assets into a cohesive model.\n\nMotivated by the potential of collective intelligence in achieving superhuman performance and the benefits derived from multi-agent collaborative learning, this paper introduces \"CollabSens,\" a novel approach to sequentially ingest and integrate multiple intermediate features from a representation network using an ensemble of intelligent nodes. This mechanism leverages the strengths of these nodes to sequentially enhance the model's overall semantic reasoning capabilities.\n\nGuided by extensive empirical investigations, we demonstrate that our proposed architecture significantly outperforms baseline models by fusing pre-trained perceptual and textual representations, leading to 14% improved accuracy in semantic classification tasks across various domains, including ImageNet Limited and Visual Genome. Notably, the proposed ensemble aggregation strategy enables our framework to maintain robustness in the face of noisy or misleading visual cues, attributing to a 'user-friendly' ability of robust semantic categorization.\n\nTo encourage further advancements in domain-specific semantic understanding, we have made the CollabSens framework open-source, inheriting the principles of reflexivity-through-sharing adaptivity between agents, enhancement of local and global semantic representations, and aggregation of intermediate features to achieve more contextually pertinent insights.\n\nIn summary, this paper aims to unveil the scalability and adaptability of multi-agent collaborative learning in the realm of multimodal semantic interpretation, exemplifying its potential in improving representation learning through multisembolic collective intelligence, and encouraging the confluence of ideas in building more robust, informed and user-centric semantic categorization systems.]"}]}}

Traditionally, 2D image analyses have relied on well-established representations and algorithms, leading to accurate estimations for perspective images. However, 3D pose estimation from classic depth maps presents significant challenges due to the nature of the data and the complexity involved in handling information across spatial dimensions.\n\nThis research advances the state-of-the-art by proposing Layered Depth Learning (LDL), an innovative method that bridges the gap between the 2D dimensionality reduction techniques used in classical computer vision and the feasible 3D understanding from layered depth inputs. By leveraging a series of simultaneous pose estimation tasks, LDL tackles the intricacies of 3D data directly, enriching the capabilities of existing methodologies.\n\nThe innovation lies in the development of a multi-resolution approach which allows for both spatial detail and context awareness. The method integrates depth information from various fields of the image, focusing on the detection of individual objects within a complex scene. By establishing links between the layers based on semantics rather than physical proximity, LDL establishes a new pathway for dynamic 3D understanding from depth inputs.\n\nThe method applies layered segmentation, where the scene is systematically divided into homogeneous layers, each partition classifying objects within a specific dimension of the space. This instance-aware classification, detailed with spatial coordinates, provides a robust foundation for subsequent analysis. The LDL technique trains a model that learns to differentiate objects within layered fields, resulting in accurate pose estimation. A self-aligned normalization scheme ensures consistency and accuracy across layers, enhancing the overall precision of the prediction. \n\nIn terms of methodology, LDL engages in an iterative training process, gradually incorporating more layers in subsequent training rounds, thus improving spatial resolution and context awareness. A novel self-supervised learning model is engineered, capable of optimizing the parameters for depth mapping through advanced regularization techniques that align with the predictions of pose estimations.\n\nReflecting the abovementioned theoretical framework, experimental evidence demonstrates that LDL surpasses the mainstream models in pose estimation accuracy for complex scenes, being especially proficient in handling multiple objects of varying depths within a single view. Over 20% enhancement in accuracy across benchmark datasets (e.g., a combination of common pose estimation tasks on standard datasets) highlights the efficacy and potential of LDL in advancing beyond the realms of 2D image processing.\n\nTo reinforce the potential applicability and deployment of LDL, the findings are discussed in the context of various practical scenarios. The method's high precision and adaptability provide a compelling case for integration into a suite of emerging technological sectors, from augmented reality software to enhanced surveillance systems and sophisticated robotics. Upon successful incorporation of LDL, these industries could see significant improvements, particularly in the areas of machinery and automation, where enhanced 3D understanding promises substantial gains in operational efficiency.\n\nIn conclusion, LDL pioneers a novel direction for 3D pose estimation, extending the capabilities of computer vision and interactive systems. By leveraging layered depth information and advanced contextual learning, this research not only improves the foundational understanding of complex scenes but also paves the way for future advancements in multidimensional data processing and interpretation. The impact of LDL on the field of machine learning, and thus technology as a whole, promises to be transformative. Our contributions enhance the versatility of AI in discerning and operating within complex physical environments, reaffirming the potential of layered depth learning as a foundational approach in the realm of machine learning and computer vision.]"}]}}

Traditionally, 2D image analyses have relied on well-established representations and algorithms, leading to accurate estimations for perspective images. However, 3D pose estimation from classic depth maps presents significant challenges due to the nature of the data and the complexity involved in handling information across spatial dimensions.\n\nThis research advances the state-of-the-art by proposing Layered Depth Learning (LDL), an innovative method that bridges the gap between the 2D dimensionality reduction techniques used in classical computer vision and the feasible 3D understanding from layered depth inputs. By leveraging a series of simultaneous pose estimation tasks, LDL tackles the intricacies of 3D data directly, enriching the capabilities of existing methodologies.\n\nThe innovation lies in the development of a multi-resolution approach which allows for both spatial detail and context awareness. The method integrates depth information from various fields of the image, focusing on the detection of individual objects within a complex scene. By establishing links between the layers based on semantics rather than physical proximity, LDL establishes a new pathway for dynamic 3D understanding from depth inputs.\n\nThe method applies layered segmentation, where the scene is systematically divided into homogeneous layers, each partition classifying objects within a specific dimension of the space. This instance-aware classification, detailed with spatial coordinates, provides a robust foundation for subsequent analysis. The LDL technique trains a model that learns to differentiate objects within layered fields, resulting in accurate pose estimation. A self-aligned normalization scheme ensures consistency and accuracy across layers, enhancing the overall precision of the prediction. \n\nIn terms of methodology, LDL engages in an iterative training process, gradually incorporating more layers in subsequent training rounds, thus improving spatial resolution and context awareness. A novel self-supervised learning model is engineered, capable of optimizing the parameters for depth mapping through advanced regularization techniques that align with the predictions of pose estimations.\n\nReflecting the abovementioned theoretical framework, experimental evidence demonstrates that LDL surpasses the mainstream models in pose estimation accuracy for complex scenes, being especially proficient in handling multiple objects of varying depths within a single view. Over 20% enhancement in accuracy across benchmark datasets (e.g., a combination of common pose estimation tasks on standard datasets) highlights the efficacy and potential of LDL in advancing beyond the realms of 2D image processing.\n\nTo reinforce the potential applicability and deployment of LDL, the findings are discussed in the context of various practical scenarios. The method's high precision and adaptability provide a compelling case for integration into a suite of emerging technological sectors, from augmented reality software to enhanced surveillance systems and sophisticated robotics. Upon successful incorporation of LDL, these industries could see significant improvements, particularly in the areas of machinery and automation, where enhanced 3D understanding promises substantial gains in operational efficiency.\n\nIn conclusion, LDL pioneers a novel direction for 3D pose estimation, extending the capabilities of computer vision and interactive systems. By leveraging layered depth information and advanced contextual learning, this research not only improves the foundational understanding of complex scenes but also paves the way for future advancements in multidimensional data processing and interpretation. The impact of LDL on the field of machine learning, and thus technology as a whole, promises to be transformative. Our contributions enhance the versatility of AI in discerning and operating within complex physical environments, reaffirming the potential of layered depth learning as a foundational approach in the realm of machine learning and computer vision.]"}]}}

Yet, the pre-training process for\nvideo-related tasks demands exceptionally large computational and data\nresources, which hinders the progress of video-language models. This paper\ninvestigates a straight-forward, highly efficient, and resource-light approach\nto adapting an existing image-language pre-trained model for dense video\nunderstanding. Our preliminary experiments reveal that directly fine-tuning\npre-trained image-language models with multiple frames as inputs on video\ndatasets leads to performance saturation or even a drop. Our further\ninvestigation reveals that it is largely attributed to the bias of learned\nhigh-norm visual features. Motivated by this finding, we propose a simple but\neffective pooling strategy to smooth the feature distribution along the\ntemporal dimension and thus reduce the dominant impacts from the extreme\nfeatures. The new model is termed Pooling LLaVA, or PLLaVA in short. PLLaVA\nachieves new state-of-the-art performance on modern benchmark datasets for both\nvideo question-answer and captioning tasks. Notably, on the recent popular\nVideoChatGPT benchmark, PLLaVA achieves a score of 3.48 out of 5 on average of\nfive evaluated dimensions, exceeding the previous SOTA results from GPT4V\n(IG-VLM) by 9%. On the latest multi-choice benchmark MVBench, PLLaVA achieves\n58.1% accuracy on average across 20 sub-tasks, 14.5% higher than GPT4V\n(IG-VLM).

Traditionally, 2D image analyses have relied on well-established representations and algorithms, leading to accurate estimations for perspective images. However, 3D pose estimation from classic depth maps presents significant challenges due to the nature of the data and the complexity involved in handling information across spatial dimensions.\n\nThis research advances the state-of-the-art by proposing Layered Depth Learning (LDL), an innovative method that bridges the gap between the 2D dimensionality reduction techniques used in classical computer vision and the feasible 3D understanding from layered depth inputs. By leveraging a series of simultaneous pose estimation tasks, LDL tackles the intricacies of 3D data directly, enriching the capabilities of existing methodologies.\n\nThe innovation lies in the development of a multi-resolution approach which allows for both spatial detail and context awareness. The method integrates depth information from various fields of the image, focusing on the detection of individual objects within a complex scene. By establishing links between the layers based on semantics rather than physical proximity, LDL establishes a new pathway for dynamic 3D understanding from depth inputs.\n\nThe method applies layered segmentation, where the scene is systematically divided into homogeneous layers, each partition classifying objects within a specific dimension of the space. This instance-aware classification, detailed with spatial coordinates, provides a robust foundation for subsequent analysis. The LDL technique trains a model that learns to differentiate objects within layered fields, resulting in accurate pose estimation. A self-aligned normalization scheme ensures consistency and accuracy across layers, enhancing the overall precision of the prediction. \n\nIn terms of methodology, LDL engages in an iterative training process, gradually incorporating more layers in subsequent training rounds, thus improving spatial resolution and context awareness. A novel self-supervised learning model is engineered, capable of optimizing the parameters for depth mapping through advanced regularization techniques that align with the predictions of pose estimations.\n\nReflecting the abovementioned theoretical framework, experimental evidence demonstrates that LDL surpasses the mainstream models in pose estimation accuracy for complex scenes, being especially proficient in handling multiple objects of varying depths within a single view. Over 20% enhancement in accuracy across benchmark datasets (e.g., a combination of common pose estimation tasks on standard datasets) highlights the efficacy and potential of LDL in advancing beyond the realms of 2D image processing.\n\nTo reinforce the potential applicability and deployment of LDL, the findings are discussed in the context of various practical scenarios. The method's high precision and adaptability provide a compelling case for integration into a suite of emerging technological sectors, from augmented reality software to enhanced surveillance systems and sophisticated robotics. Upon successful incorporation of LDL, these industries could see significant improvements, particularly in the areas of machinery and automation, where enhanced 3D understanding promises substantial gains in operational efficiency.\n\nIn conclusion, LDL pioneers a novel direction for 3D pose estimation, extending the capabilities of computer vision and interactive systems. By leveraging layered depth information and advanced contextual learning, this research not only improves the foundational understanding of complex scenes but also paves the way for future advancements in multidimensional data processing and interpretation. The impact of LDL on the field of machine learning, and thus technology as a whole, promises to be transformative. Our contributions enhance the versatility of AI in discerning and operating within complex physical environments, reaffirming the potential of layered depth learning as a foundational approach in the realm of machine learning and computer vision.]"}]}}

The community has thus sought to develop algorithms capable of enhancing the security of deep neural networks. This paper introduces an innovative error-correcting neural network (ECNN) model, designed to mitigate the effects of malicious inputs through the pursuit of system fault tolerance and diversity among its binary classifiers. Drawing upon the principles of error-correcting output codes (ECOC), ECNN combines ensemble diversification to counteract the vulnerabilities caused by adversarial examples, ensuring more accurate and secure multi-class classifications.\n\nAn intriguing aspect of ECNN is its interplay between maximizing row distances to enhance fault tolerance, while optimizing column diversification to foster the versatility of binary classifiers. This study also explores an end-to-end training mechanism that further aids in risk analysis and operational precision, dispensing with the conventional ECOC methods which focus on training classifiers in isolation. In parallel with the existing defense mechanisms such as adversarial training, ECNN offers complementary and flexible protection, with notable performance improvements against both white-box and black-box attacks on various datasets.\n\nIn the pursuit of advanced methods for task recommendation in crowdsourcing environments, this research introduces a multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework to develop efficient strategies for identifying tasks that best align with the preferences and reliabilities of workers, enhancing overall project efficiency. Addressing the challenge of learning these worker characteristics dynamically over time, our proposed model integrates crowd worker's performance data with gold tasks \u2014 known solutions to assess reliability. The model achieves a balance between task recommendation accuracy and adaptability, optimizing the regret at $O(\\sqrt{n})$ level for a diverse set of tasks. With a specially designed sampling heuristic and practical application strategies, the system surpasses traditional methods, driving forward the potential of collaborative crowdsourcing platforms.\n\nFinally, the sequential multi-class labeling (SML) problem in crowdsourcing settings offers another layer of complexity, where a dynamic and adaptive questioning approach is pivotal. Through the evolution of a novel Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework, this work empowers a crowdsourcerer to sequentially ask questions to workers, utilizing both contextual knowledge and prior responses to optimize the prediction of hidden states. The subsequent development of a $q$-ary Ulam-R\u00e9nyi game and a practical sampling heuristic not only aligns with traditional POMDP solvers but also reduces the budget constraints while maintaining satisfactory performance outcomes. These innovations collectively represent a significant leap forward in improving the reliability and efficiency of large-scale crowdsourced labeling tasks, showcasing the potential for groundbreaking advancements in crowdsourcing and deep learning methodologies.]"}]}}

The community has thus sought to develop algorithms capable of enhancing the security of deep neural networks. This paper introduces an innovative error-correcting neural network (ECNN) model, designed to mitigate the effects of malicious inputs through the pursuit of system fault tolerance and diversity among its binary classifiers. Drawing upon the principles of error-correcting output codes (ECOC), ECNN combines ensemble diversification to counteract the vulnerabilities caused by adversarial examples, ensuring more accurate and secure multi-class classifications.\n\nAn intriguing aspect of ECNN is its interplay between maximizing row distances to enhance fault tolerance, while optimizing column diversification to foster the versatility of binary classifiers. This study also explores an end-to-end training mechanism that further aids in risk analysis and operational precision, dispensing with the conventional ECOC methods which focus on training classifiers in isolation. In parallel with the existing defense mechanisms such as adversarial training, ECNN offers complementary and flexible protection, with notable performance improvements against both white-box and black-box attacks on various datasets.\n\nIn the pursuit of advanced methods for task recommendation in crowdsourcing environments, this research introduces a multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework to develop efficient strategies for identifying tasks that best align with the preferences and reliabilities of workers, enhancing overall project efficiency. Addressing the challenge of learning these worker characteristics dynamically over time, our proposed model integrates crowd worker's performance data with gold tasks \u2014 known solutions to assess reliability. The model achieves a balance between task recommendation accuracy and adaptability, optimizing the regret at $O(\\sqrt{n})$ level for a diverse set of tasks. With a specially designed sampling heuristic and practical application strategies, the system surpasses traditional methods, driving forward the potential of collaborative crowdsourcing platforms.\n\nFinally, the sequential multi-class labeling (SML) problem in crowdsourcing settings offers another layer of complexity, where a dynamic and adaptive questioning approach is pivotal. Through the evolution of a novel Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework, this work empowers a crowdsourcerer to sequentially ask questions to workers, utilizing both contextual knowledge and prior responses to optimize the prediction of hidden states. The subsequent development of a $q$-ary Ulam-R\u00e9nyi game and a practical sampling heuristic not only aligns with traditional POMDP solvers but also reduces the budget constraints while maintaining satisfactory performance outcomes. These innovations collectively represent a significant leap forward in improving the reliability and efficiency of large-scale crowdsourced labeling tasks, showcasing the potential for groundbreaking advancements in crowdsourcing and deep learning methodologies.]"}]}}

The community has thus sought to develop algorithms capable of enhancing the security of deep neural networks. This paper introduces an innovative error-correcting neural network (ECNN) model, designed to mitigate the effects of malicious inputs through the pursuit of system fault tolerance and diversity among its binary classifiers. Drawing upon the principles of error-correcting output codes (ECOC), ECNN combines ensemble diversification to counteract the vulnerabilities caused by adversarial examples, ensuring more accurate and secure multi-class classifications.\n\nAn intriguing aspect of ECNN is its interplay between maximizing row distances to enhance fault tolerance, while optimizing column diversification to foster the versatility of binary classifiers. This study also explores an end-to-end training mechanism that further aids in risk analysis and operational precision, dispensing with the conventional ECOC methods which focus on training classifiers in isolation. In parallel with the existing defense mechanisms such as adversarial training, ECNN offers complementary and flexible protection, with notable performance improvements against both white-box and black-box attacks on various datasets.\n\nIn the pursuit of advanced methods for task recommendation in crowdsourcing environments, this research introduces a multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework to develop efficient strategies for identifying tasks that best align with the preferences and reliabilities of workers, enhancing overall project efficiency. Addressing the challenge of learning these worker characteristics dynamically over time, our proposed model integrates crowd worker's performance data with gold tasks \u2014 known solutions to assess reliability. The model achieves a balance between task recommendation accuracy and adaptability, optimizing the regret at $O(\\sqrt{n})$ level for a diverse set of tasks. With a specially designed sampling heuristic and practical application strategies, the system surpasses traditional methods, driving forward the potential of collaborative crowdsourcing platforms.\n\nFinally, the sequential multi-class labeling (SML) problem in crowdsourcing settings offers another layer of complexity, where a dynamic and adaptive questioning approach is pivotal. Through the evolution of a novel Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework, this work empowers a crowdsourcerer to sequentially ask questions to workers, utilizing both contextual knowledge and prior responses to optimize the prediction of hidden states. The subsequent development of a $q$-ary Ulam-R\u00e9nyi game and a practical sampling heuristic not only aligns with traditional POMDP solvers but also reduces the budget constraints while maintaining satisfactory performance outcomes. These innovations collectively represent a significant leap forward in improving the reliability and efficiency of large-scale crowdsourced labeling tasks, showcasing the potential for groundbreaking advancements in crowdsourcing and deep learning methodologies.]"}]}}
